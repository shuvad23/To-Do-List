# To-Do List app with Javascript
## Project Overview:

This To-Do List app allows users to efficiently manage tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring they persist after page reloads. The app dynamically updates the task list using DOM manipulation and event handling. Input validation prevents users from adding empty tasks, ensuring a smooth experience.

## Requirements:

- Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically.  

- Local Storage Integration: Save tasks in localStorage to persist data across page reloads.  

- DOM Manipulation: Create and update task elements in the list dynamically.  

- Event Handling: Handle user interactions like button clicks for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.   

- Input Validation: Prevent empty tasks from being added.



## ToDo Update Instruction

- Add an onclick event to the update button/element.
- Use prompt() to take user input (if necessary, search online for how prompt works in JavaScript).
- Assign the updated value to the corresponding DOM element.
- Save the updated value in localStorage.
